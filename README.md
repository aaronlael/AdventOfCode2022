Repo for Advent of Code 2022 solutions and inputs

Hey, another year to see how far I can get.  Last year, I tried solutions with Go (which I was learning) and Python (which I was familair with).  This year in the interest of my own time, I'll just be doing solutions in Python.

Happy Honda-Days.


Day 1:  The traditional test of "can you use the input" featuring a potential classic off by one indexing error.  It was a good time to figure out how I was going to set up my repo this year.  Last year I jammed all of my inputs into one file but I think this year I'll store all of them in separate files with the test input from the get go to make life "easier".
