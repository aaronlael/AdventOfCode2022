Repo for Advent of Code 2022 solutions and inputs

Hey, another year to see how far I can get.  Last year, I tried solutions with Go (which I was learning) and Python (which I was familair with).  This year in the interest of my own time, I'll just be doing solutions in Python.

Happy Honda-Days.


Day 1:  The traditional test of "can you use the input" featuring a potential classic off by one indexing error.  It was a good time to figure out how I was going to set up my repo this year.  Last year I jammed all of my inputs into one file but I think this year I'll store all of them in separate files with the test input from the get go to make life "easier". 

Day 2:  I made dictionaries to map the outcomes then parse the input.  I'm sure there was a way that required less thought and manual setup, but it worked the first time performantly which is all I really care about.  Nhawdge will show me the way later.

Day 3:  This felt like an exercise on string slicing based on length and indexing through a list with steps larger than 1.  It was pretty straight forward once I had some coffee in me.  Curse Nhawdge for being a night owl and pulling ahead of me on the private leaderboard.  Curse him.

Day 4:  This one felt like (to me) an excercise in splitting data and using logic to compare values.  It features common errors like incorrect results if you do not cast string representations of numbers to the actual numbers as well as the opportunity to make a very poorly performing solution by actually generated the ranges of numbers like in the example to see if the ranges overlap.
